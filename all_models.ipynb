    "# Notebook Description: Model Comparison for Regression Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook compares different regression techniques for predicting student performance based on demographic and academic factors. The goal is to evaluate the performance of various regression models and identify the most suitable one for the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook begins by importing necessary libraries and modules for data manipulation, visualization, and model building. It includes modules for implementing different regression techniques such as linear regression, regularized linear regression, and Bayesian linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is loaded using pandas from a CSV file ('train.csv') containing student performance data. Preprocessing steps include partitioning the dataset into training and testing sets, as well as normalization using mean and standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "Four different regression techniques are compared:\n",
    "1. **Linear Regression (1b)**: Basic linear regression model without regularization.\n",
    "2. **Regularized Linear Regression (1c)**: Linear regression model with regularization (e.g., Lasso or Ridge) to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "3. **Regularized Biased Linear Regression (1d)**: Linear regression model with regularization and a bias term to account for bias in the data.\n",
    "4. **Bayesian Linear Regression (1e)**: Probabilistic approach to linear regression using Bayesian inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each technique, the notebook computes the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and generates predictions (`yhat`) for the testing set. These predictions are then plotted against the ground truth values to visually compare the performance of each model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "A comparison plot (`plot_1f`) is generated to visualize the predictions of all models alongside the ground truth values. This plot provides insights into the performance of each regression technique and helps identify the best-performing model based on RMSE.\n",
