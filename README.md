# Regression and Classification of Student Performance Data Set

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict and classify student performance using machine learning models. The dataset used is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains various attributes related to student demographics, family background, and academic performance. The goal is to develop regression models to predict student grades and classification models to classify students into predefined categories based on their performance.

## Problem Statement

The problem involves predicting student performance based on demographic and academic factors. This information can be valuable for educators and policymakers to identify at-risk students early and provide targeted interventions to improve their academic outcomes.

## Data Source

The dataset is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:

## Models Compared

1. **Linear Regression**: A basic regression model that fits a linear relationship between input features and the target variable.
   
2. **Regularized Linear Regression**: Linear regression with regularization techniques such as Lasso or Ridge to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization.

3. **Regularized Biased Linear Regression**: Similar to regularized linear regression but includes a bias term to account for bias in the data.

4. **Bayesian Linear Regression**: A probabilistic approach to linear regression that models uncertainty in the parameters using Bayesian inference.

## Solution

### Data Preprocessing

- Data cleaning: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and removing outliers.
- Feature engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.

### Model Building

- Implementing each regression model using appropriate libraries such as scikit-learn or TensorFlow.
- Hyperparameter tuning: Optimizing model parameters to improve predictive performance.

### Model Evaluation

- Evaluating model performance using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) for regression and accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for classification.
- Comparing models based on their performance metrics to identify the best-performing model for each task.

## Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow

## Next Steps

- Experiment with different feature combinations and preprocessing techniques to further improve model performance.
- Explore ensemble methods such as random forests or gradient boosting to potentially enhance predictive accuracy.
- Deploy the best-performing models in a real-world setting for practical applications in education or student support systems.
